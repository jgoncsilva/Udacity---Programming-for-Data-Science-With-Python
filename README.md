# Programming With Data Science With Python 
## 1ST Project = Investigate a Database (SQL)

### jgoncsilva

## Description (by me) 
For this project. We need to use the knowledge acquired in the SQL program.

Using the Sakilla database. We have the mission to obtain results from queries and from them create a presentation about the interesting data found using the knowledge extracted through the database.

Ps .: The skills of creating graphics and handling excel at the time of delivery of the project were in the initial stage. After the project I tried to improve these skills and in the near future I will make commits after finding better views and questions.)

I had 2 sets of questions given by Udacity. In which the expected results to be obtained were shown and for the project I used these questions.

For SQL series of requirements like
1) Use subqueries or CTE, windows functions, aggregations and JOINS (a lot of them)
2) Format correctly and use Aliases.
3) Obtain the expected results through the questions raised.

For presentation a PDF
1) Questions and captions without explanations about SQL / Statistics / Excel or any other knowledge used.
2) Use of axis, titles.
3) Provide accurate analysis was the goal!

Ps.:We had a Rubric.

For me it was a challenging project since I had never had any contact with SQL, Databases, Graphs and tables in Excel in ALL MY LIFE.

I learned a lot! I have a lot to improve!
But the important thing is that I really enjoyed doing this project!

My experience: This project was very interesting to insert me in the world of data. SQL is still a powerful tool for data analysis even with Big data and NoSQL databases with great expression in the market. It was extremely productive!


## Project 2 - Explore US Bikeshare Data (Python)
...In progress...

## Project 3 - Post Your Work on Github (Git)

In this project, you will create a GitHub repository and your local repository. You will work on a repo for your BikeShare project, making multiple branches, making edits to files on those branches (e.g., a readme file and your Python code), and then you will commit the changes to your remote repository.

##### The results still in progress... (28-05-2020)


You can find the working progress of course [here](https://github.com/jgoncsilva/Git-github-pratice)
