'''How to Search
Here are some techniques for effective web searching:

Try using "Python" or the name of the library you're using as the first word of your query.
This tells the search engine to prioritize results that are explicitly related to the tools you're using.
Writing a good search query can take multiple attempts. If you don't find helpful results on your first attemp try again.
Try using keywords found on the pages you found in your initial search to direct the search engine to better resources in the subsequent search.
Copy and paste error messages to use as search terms. This will lead you to explanations of the error and potential causes. An error message might include references to specific line numbers of code that you wrote. Only include the part of the error message that comes before this in your search.
If you can't find an answer to your question, ask it yourself! Communities like StackOverflow have etiquette rules you must learn if you want to participate, but don't let this stop you from using these resources.'''

#Question: Create a function that opens the flowers.txt, reads every line in it, and saves it as a dictionary.

It should then use it to print the flower name with the same first letter (from dictionary created in the first function).

#>>> Enter your First [space] Last name only: Bill Newman
#>>> Unique flower name with the first letter: Bellflower
#function that creates a flower_dictionary from filename

            flower = line.split(": ")[1].strip()
            flower_dict[letter] = flower
    return flower_dict

# Main function that prompts for user input, parses out the first letter
# includes function call for create_flowerdict to create dictionary
