B. Reserved Words
You may not name your variables any of the following words as they mean special things in Python:

and	assert	break	class	continue
def	del	elif	else	except
exec	finally	for	from	global
if	import	in	is	lambda
not	or	pass	print	raise
return	try	while		
Do NOT use any of the following words either (although they are not strictly Python reserved words, they conflict with the names of commonly-used Python functions):

Data	Float	Int	Numeric	Oxphys
array	close	float	int	input
open	range	type	write	zeros
You should also avoid all the names defined in the math library (you must avoid them if you import the library):

acos	asin	atan	cos	e
exp	fabs	floor	log	log10
pi	sin	sqrt	tan
